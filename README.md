We are making an integrated automated system for the Health Center at IIT Kanpur.


This project is made as part of our course project - CS253 - Software Development and Operations.


At present most of the documentation records are handled on paper in the Health Center at IIT Kanpur. Our team decided to make a Web-based App to automate the appointment and prescription procedure.
